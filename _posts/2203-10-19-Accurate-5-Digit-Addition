# Introduction
The <a href="{{site.url}}/2023/10/14/Understanding-Addition.html">previous post</a> discussed how a toy (1-layer, 3-head) transformer model answers integer addition questions like "33357+82243=".

It summarised the model's addition algorithm like this and stated it could solve > 99.5% of integer addition questions:

This post documents how to improve that model to do 5-digit addition 100% accurately.

The same CoLab notepad as before can be downloaded from <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/Accurate_Addition_in_Transformers.ipynb">here</a>, 
and used to train and test the model. You can alter the code to try out other approaches.
